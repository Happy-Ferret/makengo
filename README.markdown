<tt>Makengo</tt> (make'n go) is a build program written in <tt>go</tt>
and inspired to <tt>ruby</tt> <tt>rake</tt>.

# Preamble

When I switched from <tt>ruby</tt> to <tt>go</tt> there was a thing I
particularly missed: a build program Ã  la <tt>rake</tt>. So, I decided
to make an attempt trying to roughly reproduce <tt>rake</tt>'s DSL in
<tt>go</tt> and I ended up with what follows.

Please note that this software is in an early alpha stage of
development. If you find it interesting feel free to send me feedbacks
or better to fork it and send me patches ;)

# Quick start

    $ git clone http://github.com/remogatto/makengo
    $ cd makengo
    $ make install

# The DSL

## Define a simple task without dependencies

    Task("Hello", func() { fmt.Println("Hello!") })

## Define two dependent tasks (order of definition doesn't matter)

    Task("Joe", func() { fmt.Println("Joe") })
    Task("Hello", func() { fmt.Println("Hello ") }).DependsOn("Joe")

## Add descriptions to tasks

    Desc("Print hello.")
    Task("Hello", func() { fmt.Println("Hello!") })

## Define a default task among a set of defined tasks

    Task("Hello", func() { fmt.Println("Hello!") })
    Default("Hello")

# Makengo file

Tasks are defined inside a file named Makengo and embraced by a init()
function.

## Makengo file example

    package main

    import ( 
             "fmt" 
             . "makengo" 
    )

    func init() {
            Desc("Print hello.")
            Task("Hello", func() { fmt.Println("Hello!") })
    }

# Tasks execution and command-line

Tasks are invoked using makengo executable:

    $ makengo # Run the default task if any
    $ makengo Hello # Run "Hello" task
    $ makengo Hello Joe # Run "Hello" and "Joe" tasks
    $ makengo -T # Show task descriptions
    $ makengo -h # Show usage information

# Concurrency

I desired to look at one of go's neatest feature: goroutines. Concurrency 
is exploited following these rules:

1. Independent tasks run concurrently. 

2. If task1 depends on (task2, task3) and (task2, task3) are independent 
tasks then (task2, task3) run concurrently and task1 waits for (task2, 
task3) to finish their job.
